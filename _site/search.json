Participants would have been asked about their age and the amount they spent on various Valentine’s Day gifts.\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning: Removing any incomplete or inconsistent data.\nGrouping: Categorizing the age data into specific ranges (18-24, 25-34, etc.).\nAggregation: Calculating the average spending per gift category for each age group.\nHypothesis/Research Question: A possible hypothesis or research question could be: “Does the amount spent on Valentine’s Day gifts vary significantly across different age groups?”\n\n\n\n\nAs the age group increases, the overall spending on Valentine’s Day gifts tends to decrease. However, the spending patterns for different gift categories vary. While younger age groups spend more on items like candy and clothing, older age groups prioritize more sentimental gifts like greeting cards and jewelry.\n\n\n\nDecreasing Spending with Age: As the age group increases, the overall spending on Valentine’s Day gifts generally declines. This suggests that romantic gestures may become less extravagant or frequent with age. Shift in Spending Priorities: The spending patterns for different gift categories vary significantly across age groups. Younger individuals tend to focus on more tangible items like candy and clothing, while older individuals prioritize sentimental gifts such as greeting cards and jewelry.\nChanging Lifestyles: As people age, their lifestyles, financial situations, and priorities may change, influencing their spending habits on Valentine’s Day. Relationship Dynamics: The nature of relationships may evolve over time, leading to different ways of celebrating Valentine’s Day. Cultural Factors: Societal norms and expectations regarding Valentine’s Day celebrations may vary across age groups and cultural contexts."

Participants would have been asked about their age and the amount they spent on various Valentine’s Day gifts.\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning: Removing any incomplete or inconsistent data.\nGrouping: Categorizing the age data into specific ranges (18-24, 25-34, etc.).\nAggregation: Calculating the average spending per gift category for each age group.\nHypothesis/Research Question: A possible hypothesis or research question could be: “Does the amount spent on Valentine’s Day gifts vary significantly across different age groups?”\n\n\n\n\nAs the age group increases, the overall spending on Valentine’s Day gifts tends to decrease. However, the spending patterns for different gift categories vary. While younger age groups spend more on items like candy and clothing, older age groups prioritize more sentimental gifts like greeting cards and jewelry.\n\n\n\nDecreasing Spending with Age: As the age group increases, the overall spending on Valentine’s Day gifts generally declines. This suggests that romantic gestures may become less extravagant or frequent with age. Shift in Spending Priorities: The spending patterns for different gift categories vary significantly across age groups. Younger individuals tend to focus on more tangible items like candy and clothing, while older individuals prioritize sentimental gifts such as greeting cards and jewelry.\nChanging Lifestyles: As people age, their lifestyles, financial situations, and priorities may change, influencing their spending habits on Valentine’s Day. Relationship Dynamics: The nature of relationships may evolve over time, leading to different ways of celebrating Valentine’s Day. Cultural Factors: Societal norms and expectations regarding Valentine’s Day celebrations may vary across age groups and cultural contexts."

While the values in the example are all “2016,” they are still considered quantitative as they represent a specific year.\n\n\n\n\n\noccupation: This variable is a character, indicating it represents text or categorical data.

However, there are also outliers that don’t follow this pattern.\nVariation in Salary Within Categories: Even within the same major category (e.g., Healthcare Practitioners and Technical), there’s a significant variation in median salaries among different occupations.\nInfluence of Total Workers: The size of the points (representing the total number of workers) might indicate that occupations with larger workforces tend to have higher median salaries, but this correlation is not entirely clear from the limited data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

This could be calculated based on the number of females and the total number of workers.\n\nData Visualization:\n\nCreate the scatter plot: Use ggplot2 or similar libraries to create the scatter plot, mapping the appropriate variables to the x-axis, y-axis, and point size."

While the values in the example are all “2016,” they are still considered quantitative as they represent a specific year.\n\n\n\n\n\noccupation: This variable is a character, indicating it represents text or categorical data. Each occupation is a distinct category.\nmajor_category: This variable is also a character, representing categorical data. Each major category is a distinct group of occupations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation between Salary and Female Representation: There seems to be a general trend where occupations with higher percentages of female representation tend to have lower median salaries. However, there are also outliers that don’t follow this pattern.\nVariation in Salary Within Categories: Even within the same major category (e.g., Healthcare Practitioners and Technical), there’s a significant variation in median salaries among different occupations.\nInfluence of Total Workers: The size of the points (representing the total number of workers) might indicate that occupations with larger workforces tend to have higher median salaries, but this correlation is not entirely clear from the limited data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

The trend in the plot is that occupations with higher percentage of females tend to have lower median salaries. However, there are outliars that did not follow this trend.\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning:\n\nHandle missing values: Remove rows with missing values or impute them using appropriate methods.\n\nCorrect data types: Ensure that numerical variables (e.g., SALARY, NO_OF_WORKERS) are of numeric data type.\n\nFeature Engineering:\n\nCreate a gender percentage variable: If GENDER is a categorical variable, create a new numerical variable representing the percentage of females in the occupation. This could be calculated based on the number of females and the total number of workers.\n\nData Visualization:\n\nCreate the scatter plot: Use ggplot2 or similar libraries to create the scatter plot, mapping the appropriate variables to the x-axis, y-axis, and point size."

It aims to answer the following questions:\n\nDo different genres have varying levels of profitability?\nAre there significant differences in profit ratios among different distributors?\nIs there an interaction between genre and distributor that affects profitability?\n\nIn other words, the graph investigates whether the profitability of a film is influenced more by its genre, the distributor, or a combination of both factors. By visualizing the median profit ratios for each combination of genre and distributor, the graph provides insights into these relationships.\nGeneral Observations:\n\nProfit Ratios: The median profit ratios are generally between 1x and 3x, indicating that most films make at least their production budgets back but don’t necessarily achieve massive profits.\nGenre Variation: There is some variation in profit ratios across genres, but the differences are not as pronounced as might be expected.\nDistributor Variation: While there are some differences in profit ratios among distributors, they are also not as striking as might be anticipated.\n\nSpecific Inferences:\n\nHorror and Comedy: Horror films tend to have slightly higher median profit ratios compared to other genres, suggesting they might be more commercially successful. Comedy films, on the other hand, seem to have slightly lower profit ratios.\nAdventure and Action: These genres appear to have relatively consistent profit ratios across distributors, indicating that their profitability might be less influenced by the distributor.\nDistributor Performance: Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures seem to have slightly higher median profit ratios overall, suggesting they might be more effective in maximizing profits.

It aims to answer the following questions:\n\nDo different genres have varying levels of profitability?\nAre there significant differences in profit ratios among different distributors?\nIs there an interaction between genre and distributor that affects profitability?\n\nIn other words, the graph investigates whether the profitability of a film is influenced more by its genre, the distributor, or a combination of both factors. By visualizing the median profit ratios for each combination of genre and distributor, the graph provides insights into these relationships.\nGeneral Observations:\n\nProfit Ratios: The median profit ratios are generally between 1x and 3x, indicating that most films make at least their production budgets back but don’t necessarily achieve massive profits.\nGenre Variation: There is some variation in profit ratios across genres, but the differences are not as pronounced as might be expected.\nDistributor Variation: While there are some differences in profit ratios among distributors, they are also not as striking as might be anticipated.\n\nSpecific Inferences:\n\nHorror and Comedy: Horror films tend to have slightly higher median profit ratios compared to other genres, suggesting they might be more commercially successful. Comedy films, on the other hand, seem to have slightly lower profit ratios.\nAdventure and Action: These genres appear to have relatively consistent profit ratios across distributors, indicating that their profitability might be less influenced by the distributor.\nDistributor Performance: Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures seem to have slightly higher median profit ratios overall, suggesting they might be more effective in maximizing profits. However, the differences are not substantial.\nOther Distributors: The “Other” category, which likely represents smaller or independent distributors, shows a wider range of profit ratios, indicating more variability in their performance.\n\nLimitations:\n\nMedian Profit Ratio: The graph only shows median profit ratios. There might be significant variations within each genre and distributor, which are not captured by the median.\nSample Size: The sample size for each combination of genre and distributor might be relatively small, limiting the generalizability of the findings.\nOther Factors: The graph does not account for other factors that might influence profitability, such as release date, star power, or marketing budget.\n\nOverall, the graph suggests that while there are some differences in profitability across genres and distributors, these differences are not as pronounced as might be expected.
