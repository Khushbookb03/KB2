## Introduction

This is a wonderful class but I am currently typing shit. It seems fun though

## My first piece, getting started

### Trying out with 3 hashes

#### does 4 hash do anything? yes, every hash decreases font size

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)
```

```{r}

babynames

```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Aditi")
```

```{r}
babynames%>% filter (name=="Aditi")%>%
  gf_line(n~year)
```

Who is Aditi, she got pretty popular

```{r}
babynames%>% filter (name=="Khushboo")
```

```{r}
babynames%>% filter (name=="Khushboo") %>%
  gf_line(n~year)
```

```{r}
babynames%>% filter(name=="Sachi")

```
